 <h2>My Top 3 Movies of all-time</h2>
 <hr />

 <h3>Green book</h3>
 <p>A successful and elegant pianist, Dr. Don Shirley, who is black hires an ill mannered white bouncer, Tony Lip, as his driver to take him on tour to the deep south in 1960s America. Now, this is a very serious and sensitive topic but it is surprisingly well handled with gentleness, warmth and lots of humour. The title refers to the book, which people of colour used to refer to while looking for a place to stay in the deep south as in those days racial segregation was still followed there. The racial confrontations are deftly handled and one can see the craft of Mahershala Ali shine in these scenes. Also, this movie feels like a "road trip drama" and focusses more on the relationship between the two men. It also helps that these two men are played by Ali and Viggo Mortensen. Both of them are fabulous (Ali's finger movements on the piano are particularly convincing) and the increasing camaraderie between them is a joy to watch. The success of the movie ultimately lies in the nuanced and straightforward way it tells its story and also in the way that the lead actors carry this movie, which make even potential cringe worthy scenes, rewarding.</p>

 <h3>About Time</h3>
 <p>It's one of the best movie about life. Watch it. It'll change how you live your life</p>
 
 <h3>Intouchables</h3>
 <p>This is one of my favourite films. It is very funny and uplifting. Whenever someone asks for film recommendations, this is what I recommend.</p>
